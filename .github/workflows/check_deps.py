"""Script to check that `requirements.txt` and `environment.yml` are synced.

This script requires `pyyaml` to read `environment.yml`. It checks that all
packages listed as dependencies in it are also present in one of
`requirements.txt` or `extra_libraries.txt`.

As there might be some discrepency between package names in `pip` and `conda`,
one can add the name of the corresponding conda package as a comment on the
same line as a requirement in `requirements.txt` to ensure proper matching.
For instance, if one add the following line in `requirements.txt`

> tensorflow-gpu  # tensorflow

it will match a dependency `tensorflow` in the `environment.yml`.
